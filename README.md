What is CUCUMBER?

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. In BDD, users (business analysts, product owners) first write scenarios or acceptance tests that describe the behavior of the system from the customerâ€™s perspective, for review and sign-off by the product owners before developers write their codes. Cucumber framework uses Ruby programming language.

For examples:

Given that a fund transfer module in net banking application has been developed
And I am accessing it with proper authentication

When I shall transfer with enough balance in my source account
Or I shall transfer on a Bank Holiday
Or I shall transfer on a future date
And destination a/c details are correct
And transaction password/RSA code/security authentication for the transaction is correct
And press or click send button

Then amount must be transferred
And the event will be logged in log file
